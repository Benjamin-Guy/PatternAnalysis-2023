# Implementation of a brain MRI super-resolution network
## Benjamin Guy 46972990

In this recognition task, a super-resolution network model will be created that can up-scale by a factor of 4 on downsampled ADNI brain MRI scan images to produce a reasonably clear image. The dataset used for this task will be the [ADNI brain dataset](https://adni.loni.usc.edu/). Down-sampled data with a factor of 4 will be created from the data for training, with the model expected to up-scale this data back to its original resolution.
